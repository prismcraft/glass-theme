# Angular Example

This repo ships an Angular adapter package (`@prismcraft/glass-angular`) intended for use in an Angular CLI project.

To try it quickly:

1. Create a new Angular app:

```bash
npm create @angular@latest
```

2. Install workspace packages (after you publish) or use a local link.

3. Import directives and CSS as shown in `packages/glass-angular/README.md`.
